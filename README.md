# User

It is a bash script that is focused on making it easy for anyone to add or remove users in the Linux environment and not 
remember the command of it. Once you install it then you can call it any directory by the command User. 

NOTE - Install this in your root directory for this to work properly as intended. 

1. Clone this file in your root directory, or once you have downloaded it move it to the root directory

2. Run the install.sh script. It will make user.sh run globally from any directory

3. Type User and you are free to add any user in your Linux environment
